iMate，a tool for iOS development. Show apps and data files in devices and simulators, install, run app in simulator. 

My customer said:

```I tried a couple of similar apps (OpenSim, .....), but this one does alllllll I want. Finds the corresponding folders of my current Xcode project, install/uninstall apps and find these f***ng folders that uses 50% of my SSD to store archives that I (as an active GIT user) don´t need. Thanks to the developer for the clear concept```
